choose_sense:
	use model to select square based on state
	
choose_move:
	reward function = material differential + number of your possible moves that access e4, e5, d4, d5 squares including pawn captures
		may need to pass possible_moves to model to compute reward
	use model to decide
	
	
model properties:
	reward function = material differential + number of your possible moves that access e4, e5, d4, d5 squares including pawn captures
	material rules: {pawn = 1, knight = 3, bishop = 3, rook = 5, queen = 9, king = 1000, None = 1}. Add for each piece you took, subtract
	for each piece lost.
	Material differential = pieces captured - pieces lost
